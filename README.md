    Valorant Team Finder is a passion project that I decided to make because I couldn't find anywhere to matchmake with folks when playing solo.

      It is a full-stack application where users can create an account and find teammates to queue with in the popular FPS game, Valorant. Users will have customized profiles showcasing which roles and agents they prefer, as well as a review system to rate how their experiences playing with that user. It will also track their statistics from the past 5 games so users can see how they've been doing in their matches. They can then join or create a team with other online users.
